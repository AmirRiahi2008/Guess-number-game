I developed an advanced to-do list project using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, featuring local storage for data persistence. This to-do list application allows users to add and delete tasks while keeping the task data stored locally in the browser. The interface is designed for ease of use and responsiveness, providing a seamless experience across different devices.
